# Stast basic

This is a module I developed to better understand the internal calculations on the basic statistical tests.
The functions  output a lot of text, but that’s because learning is the goal here so I wanted to keep track of each step.
There is a good amount of comments on the code as well.
There is also a good chance that the functions are not 100% complete because I’ve not dealt with all possible scenarios;

* One sample t-test

	T_test_OneSample(mu, xbar, S, n, alpha, tail = 'two', direction = 'none')
	
* Two Dependent Sample t-test 	 (AKA paired comparison)

	T_test_TwoDependentSamples(xbar_sample_diffs, S_sample_diffs, n , alpha, tail = 'two', direction = 'none')

* Two InDependent Sample t-test  (AKA Between samples or Independent Samples)
	
	T_test_TwoInDependentSamples(xbar_A, xbar_B, StDev_A, StDev_B, nA, nB, alpha, tail = 'two', direction = 'none')
	
* Proportions - CountDataSimpleTest

	CountDataSimpleTest (n, p, alpha=0.05)

* Proportions - Two InDependent Sample t-test

	CountData_TwoInDependentSamples(pYes1, pYes2, pYesTotal, n1, n2, alpha)

* Chi Square test

	ChiSquare_test(df, debug=False)

*  One Way ANOVA

	AnovaOneWay(dfObs)

## Examples:

### ANOVA:

    >>> import statsbasic as sb
    >>> labels = ['Brown', 'Green', 'Blue']
    >>> data =[[26.8, 26.9, 23.7, 25.0, 26.3, 24.8],
			   [26.4, 24.2, 28.0, 26.9, 29.1, 26.9],       
			   [26.7, 27.2, 29.9, 28.5, 29.4, 28.3]]
    >>> dfObs = sb.CreateAnovaDataFrame(labels, data)
    >>> sb.AnovaOneWay(dfObs)

### Chi Square:	

    >>> import statsbasic as sb
    >>> data = np.array([
    >>>     ['','A','B', 'C'],
    >>>     ['Bought',109,49, 168],
    >>>     ['Heard-no-buy',55,56, 78],
    >>>     ['Never heard ',36,45, 54]
    >>> ])
    >>> dfObs = pd.DataFrame(data=data[1:,1:], index=data[1:,0], columns=data[0,1:]).apply(pd.to_numeric,axis=0)
    >>> sb.ChiSquare_test(dfObs, debug=True)

### One Sample T-Test:		

    >>> import statsbasic as sb
    >>> sb.T_test_OneSample(2.9, 2.6, 0.4, 36, 0.05)
	>>> SE(xbar): 0.067
	>>> t statistic: -4.5
	>>> t crit: +-2.03
	>>> Reject Ho
	>>> CI: [2.465, 2.735]
